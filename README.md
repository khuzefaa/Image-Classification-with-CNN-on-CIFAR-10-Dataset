# Image-Classification-with-CNN-on-CIFAR-10-Dataset
 fine-tunes a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for scene classification using the Intel Image Classification dataset. The model is developed using the Keras Functional API, and employs advanced techniques such as EarlyStopping and Keras Tuner for hyperparameter tuning.
